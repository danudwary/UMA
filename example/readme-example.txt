
This directory contains files suitable for a test of the UMA programs, which should be included with this file. Files include: "sequences.fa", a FASTA-formatted set of sequences of MetH homologs, and 14 html files which are output from the PHDsec secondary structure prediction program available through the PredictProtein server at 
http://maple.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/submit_adv.html

Please follow the instructions in the UMA readme file to make a prediction. Your results may be verified by checking them against our prediction for MetH given in:
Journal of Molecular Biology (2002) 323, 585-598
or against the crystal structure (PDB code 1K98) available for the 3 C-terminal domains of MetH available through the PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/).
